<h2>About</h2>
<p>
	I am a first year PhD student in <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/civil-environmental/graduate/geotechnics/">
	Geomechanics</a> at Northwestern University. My advisor is <a href="https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/rotta-loria-alessandro.html">Alessandro Rotta Loria</a>.
	My research interests lie in the intersection of geomechanics, engineering mechanics and energy, in a context of engineered materials,
	specifically electrokinetic remediation of soil materials to improve their properties and increase resilience of structures.
</p>
	
<p>
	I received a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2017 and 
	a Master in Science from Stanford University in March 2019. While at Illinois, I was advised by Dr. Timothy Stark and my research 
	involved exploring the Fully Softened Shear Strength for Slope Stability Analysis. In Stanford, I was advised by Dr. Ronaldo Borja
	and my research involved using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to model flow-slides of natural slopes. Additionally, I have
	worked as a geotechnical engineering intern in Cal Engineering & Geology in San Jose (supervised by Dan Peluso). My worked included
	performing 3D settlement and slope stability analyses and performing geotechnical field investigations and posterior geotechnical
	reports.
