I have played the piano since I was 5 years old. I started learning in Guayquil,Ecuador and had as instructor Ms. Liuba Gagliardo who is a profesional piano and singing teacher with a lot of expirience. I dominate music theory and have a lot of experience in stage such as performances in main theaters of Guayaquil such as the Center of Arts theater and the Crystal Palace. I have had an arduous training process and have an extreme passion for piano performing. Since my university studies is the main activity I am focusing on, I don't practice as much as I used to and now consider the piano as a relaxing tool.
